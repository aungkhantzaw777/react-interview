# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### My Code Overview
I split baseUrl by another file named baseUrl.js. so it changable. I make sure to finish task 2 and 3. because I apply for front end developer position. 
the library that I use in this project is below
- tailwindcss for ui
- react dom router for switch pages
- postCss for changing theme
- craco for PostCss configuration
